**WARNING!** the extension is still in pre-alpha stage

`gjump` is yet another [EasyMotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) inspired movement plugin. More specifically, it's a clone of [Find Then Jump](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tranhl.find-then-jump) but tweaked to be more suited for my brain
