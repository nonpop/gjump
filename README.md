**WARNING!** the extension is still in pre-alpha stage

`gjump` is yet another [EasyMotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) inspired movement plugin. More specifically, it's a clone of [Find Then Jump](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tranhl.find-then-jump) but tweaked to be more suited for my brain

## Features

- Execute `gjump.initJump` from a shortcut
- Type some characters from where you want to jump to
- Type the target character to jump

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings (TODO):

- `gjump.labels`: The available target labels
